TOPIC: Arithmetic Operators 

For Addition : +
For Subtraction : -
For Multiplication : *
For Division: /

TODO For Example

There are 5 Students in the class. All students have given their tests.
Marks of the students are as follow:
70, 80, 75, 65,and 50.

What is the average result of the class.

NOTE print() is a useful built-in function that displays input value
     as text in the output.

# CODE START

# print(2+3)
# print(9-4)
# print(7*0)
# print(7/6)

# print((70+80++75+65+50)/5)

# Some Other Arithmetic opertors
# Exponentiation : Used for power e.g. 3**2

# CODE START

# print (3**9)

# print(2**1)
# print(2**2)
# print(2**3)
# print(2**4)
# print(2**5)
# print(2**6)
# print(2**7)
# print(2**8)
# print(2**9)
# print(2**10)
# print(2**11)
# print(2**12)
# print(2**13)
# print(2**14)

There's another operator that is sometimes mistaken for the exponential operator.
The caret (^), this actually performs a more abscure operation called bitwise XOR
NOTE Will Cover later.

'''
Another useful operator is this '%' sign which performs the modulo operation.
It returns the remainder after you've divided the first number by the second.

FOR EXAMPLE
'''

# CODE START
# print(4%2)
# 7-6 = 1
# print(7%6)
# 12-2 = 10-2 = 8-2 = 6-2 = 4-2 = 2-2 =0
# print(12%2)

# CODE END



'''
Integer division denoted by '//'. It divides one integer by another but
rather than giving the exact answer, it rounds down the answer to an
integer .i.e. without decimal point
'''

# CODE START

# print(3//4)
# print(9//7)

# CODE END
