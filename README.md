<h1> Day 1 </h1>
<h2> Keywords in Pyhton </h2>
<p>
* Keywords are the reserved words in python <br>
* we can't use a keyword as variable name, function name or any other identifier <br>
* Keywords are case sentive <br>
</p>

['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'async', 'await', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'finally', 'for', 'from'
, 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield']

 total no of keywords: 35
 
 
 <h2> Identifier in Pyhton </h2>
 <p> 
 Identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module, etc. The identifier is a combination of character digits and underscore. The identifier should start with a character or Underscore then use a digit. 
</p>
 
 <h2> Comments in Python in Pyhton </h2> 
 <p> Comments are lines that exist in computer programs that are ignored by compilers and interpreters. <br>
 Symbol: # for single line <br>
 ''' for multiline ''' <br>
 
 </p>
 
 <h2> Variable </h2>
 <h2> Data Types in Python </h2>
 <p> 
 Every value in Python has a datatype. Since everything is an object in Python programming , data types are actually classes and variables are instance (object) of these classes. 
 </p>

 <h2> List in Python </h2> 
 <p> 
 * List is an Ordered sequence of items.It is one of the most used datatype in pyhton and is very flexible.
 * Declaring  a list is, items separated by commas are enclosed within brackets[].
 </p>
  Alist = [10, 20.5, "hello" ]
 
<h2> Tuple in Pyhton </h2>
<p>
Tuple is an ordered sequence of items same as list. the only difference is that tuples are immutable.
tuples once created cannot be modified. </p>
Atuple =  (1,1.5,"ML")

<h2> Set in Python </h2>
<p>
 Set is unordered collection of unique items. Set is defined by values separated by comma inside braces {}. Items in a set are not ordered. 
 </p>
 
 a = {10,30,20,40,5 }
 
<p> Note: we can perform set operations like  union , intersection on two sets. set have unique values <br>
set object does not support indexing </p>

<h2> Dictionary in Python </h2>
 <p> Dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. <br>
  in Pyhton, dictionary are defined within braces {} with each item being a pair in the form key: value. <br> key and value can be of any type.
  
 </p>
 
 d = {'a' : "apple", 'b': "bat" }


<h2> Operators in Pyhton </h2>
<p> Operators are special symbols in Python that carry out arithmetic and logical computation. <br> 
the value that operator on is called the operand.

Type : -

1. Arithmetic Operators  - <p2> Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathmatical operations like addition,subtraction,multiplication etc.<br>
2. Comparison (Relational) operators - Comparison operators sre used to compare values. It either returns True or False according to the condition. (>,<,==,!=,>=,<=,) <br>
3. Logical(Boolean) Operators - --> and, or, not  <br>
4. Bitwise Operators ---> Bitwise operators act on operands as if they were string of binary digits. It operates bit by bit (&, |, ~, ^, >>, <<) <br>
5. Assignment Operators - Assignment operators are used in pyhton to assign values to variables (=, +=, -=, /=, %=, //=, **=, &=, |=, ^=, >>=, <<=, ) <br>
6. Special Operators - 'is' and 'is not' are the identity operators in pyhton  <br>
7. Membership operators --(in and not in)  they are used to test whether a value or variable is found in a sequence (string, list, tuple, set and dictionary). <br>


</p>


<h1> Control Flow in Pyhton </h1>
<h2> if...elif...else statement </h2>
<p> the if...elif..else. statement is used in Python for decision making. </p>


 <h2> Nested-if Statement </h2>
 <p> We can have an if…elif…else statement inside another if…elif…else statement. This is called nesting in computer programming. </p>
 
 

<h5> Q1. Write a program that accepts sets of three numbers, and prints the second-maximum number among the three. </h5>
<h5> Q2. Write a program to print the sum of the first 10 numbers (1-10). </h5>
<h5> Q3. Write a program to print numbers from 1 - 10 with each number printed in a separate line. </h5>
 <h5> Q4. Pyhton program to find the largest element among three number </h5>
